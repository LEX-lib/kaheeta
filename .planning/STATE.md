# Project State

**Last updated:** 2026-06-30
**Current milestone:** v1 — Notes Feature

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-06-30)

**Core value:** Users can capture private, richly-formatted notes knowing the server stores only ciphertext — their content is readable only on their own device.
**Current focus:** Initialization — roadmap being created

## Workflow State

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Codebase map | ✓ Complete — `.planning/codebase/` |
| PROJECT.md | ✓ Complete |
| Config | ✓ Complete — YOLO / Standard / Parallel / All agents on |
| REQUIREMENTS.md | ✓ Complete — 11 v1 requirements |
| ROADMAP.md | ◆ In Progress |
| Phase 1 | ○ Pending |

## Active Phase

None yet — awaiting ROADMAP.md.

## Key Decisions Locked

- **Tiptap** as WYSIWYG editor (headless, JSON output, Vue 3-native)
- **AES-GCM** client-side encryption via Web Crypto API
- **PBKDF2** key derivation from user session — no second password
- **`kaheeta_notes`** PocketBase collection name
- **Flat list v1** — no folders, tags, or sharing

## Next Step

Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` once ROADMAP.md is complete.
